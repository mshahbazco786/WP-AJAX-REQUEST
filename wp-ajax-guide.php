To build a custom AJAX search feature in WordPress, you will need to follow these steps:
Create a search form: Use the get_search_form() function to create a basic search form or create a custom form using HTML and add it to your theme's template file.
Add jQuery and AJAX to your theme: Enqueue the jQuery library and the AJAX scripts by adding the following code to your theme's functions.php file:
*/

wp_enqueue_script( 'jquery' );
wp_enqueue_script( 'ajax-search', get_template_directory_uri() . '/js/ajax-search.js', array( 'jquery' ) );

/*
Create the AJAX search function: In the ajax-search.js file, create a function that will handle the AJAX search request. This function should use the jQuery $.ajax() method to send a GET request to the admin-ajax.php file with the search query as a parameter.

Handle the AJAX request on the server side: In your theme's functions.php file, add an action hook to handle the AJAX request. Use the wp_ajax_{action} and wp_ajax_nopriv_{action} hooks to handle logged-in and non-logged-in users, respectively. In this function, use the $_GET variable to retrieve the search query and use the WP_Query class to perform the search and return the results.

Display the search results: Use jQuery to update the search results container with the returned data and display it on the page.

 * WP AJAX Search Form Example

//  Here's an example of a search form that can be used with the AJAX code provided in the previous answer:

?>

<form id="search-form" method="post">
    <label for="search-query">Search:</label>
    <input type="text" id="search-query" name="search-query">
    <input type="submit" value="Search">
</form>
<div id="search-results"></div>


<?php

/*
This is a basic HTML form with an input field for the search query and a submit button. The form has an id of "search-form" which is used in the JavaScript/jQuery code to handle the form submission and send the AJAX request.

The form also has a div with an id of "search-results" where the search results will be displayed.

With this form and the code I provided before, when a user submits the form, the JavaScript/jQuery function will handle the form submission, send the AJAX request to the server, and update the "search-results" div with the returned search results.

It is important to note that this is a simple example, you can modify the form to add more complex search criteria, such as select boxes for categories or tags, or text inputs for custom fields.

Keep in mind that the search form will not work on its own, you need to have the AJAX code and the server-side code to handle the requests and return the search results.
